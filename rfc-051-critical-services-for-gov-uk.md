## Problem

When GOV.UK launched in 2012, the level of support it had to offer was very different to what it has to offer now. For example, there are now thousands of publishers who rely on GOV.UK's publishing tools every day, many of these who start work early in the morning or who work in different countries. We need to assess which additional services should be monitored and when

## Proposal

I recommend two additional levels of support - one is 24/7 support where we page and fix issues OOH for critical service. The other is extended hours support, where we page from 08:00 to 18:00 if issues arrive on ‘high priority’ services.

## Critical services

24/7 support

&nbsp;

| 

**Application**

 | 

**Why**

 |
| 

Signon

 | 

Signon is used to access all GOV.UK applications, whether or not they’re critical.

 |
| 

Travel Advice Publisher

 | 

Sends potentially life-saving travel advice information

 |
| 

Specialist Publisher

 | 

Specifically MHRA alerts, which send out critical drug and medical device safety information

 |
| 

Publishing API

 | 

Specifically for travel advice and MHRA alerts

 |
| 

Content store

 | 

Specifically for travel advice and MHRA alerts

 |
| 

Search

 | 

This is TBC - are we comfortable with Search being broken over a weekend? If we’re not then it’s a 24/7 application.

 |
| 

Router

 | 

Would serve redirects from the mirror if this failed. Some redirects may be out of date

 |

## High priority services

Longer support hours (08:00 - 18:00)

&nbsp;

| 

**Application**

 | 

**Why**

 |
| 

Whitehall Publisher

 | 

Used by all of government as their main publishing portal

 |
| 

Publishing API

 | 

This will become a 24/7 application as more formats start to use it

 |
| 

Content store

 | 

This will become a 24/7 application as more formats start to use it

 |
| 

Support API

 | 

Should be up and running during main publishing periods where users may need support.

 |

Teams will need to put stories in their backlogs to create monitoring for these additional services once they're agreed.
