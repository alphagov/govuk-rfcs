## Problem

We have different terms to describe what a thing is on GOV.UK.&nbsp;

&nbsp;split up format into "document type" and "schema name".

Template Consolidation's&nbsp;&nbsp;makes a distinction between "format" and "template".

This RFC is an attempt to unify the language.

## Proposal

A **document type** is what users call a thing. It's often a "real" concept, like a press release, a speech, a policy. "Is a {name}"

A **schema** defines what the data looks like.&nbsp;"Uses a {name} schema"

A **template** is what the page looks like visually. "Rendered with a&nbsp;{name} template"

The terms "format" and "content type" are discouraged.
