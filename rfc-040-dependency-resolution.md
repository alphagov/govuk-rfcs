## Problem

When content items are presented to users, they can contain information from other content items. For example, an organisation might embed/inline information about a contact.&nbsp;Both the organisation and the contact are separate content items and have separate life-cycles. When the contact is updated, the information on the organisation page should reflect this.&nbsp;At present, this information is looked up at request time and separate calls are made to the database. This slows page load times down and causes additional load on our servers.

## Proposal

Track content item dependencies and update dependent content items when content items are written to the content store. This would be the responsibility of the content store.

### How will dependencies be denoted?

We will add an optional _dependencies_ key to the default content item schema:

```
dependencies: ["content-id-1", "content-id-2"]
```

```
Â 
```

### How will this information be delivered to front-end apps?

The response from the content store will contain the dependent content items:
