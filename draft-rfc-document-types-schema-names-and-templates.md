## Problem

We have different terms to describe what a thing is on GOV.UK.

## Proposal

Following on from [https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+41%3A+Separate+document+type+from+format](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+41%3A+Separate+document+type+from+format)

A **document type** is what users call a thing. It's often a "real" concept, like a press release, a speech, a policy. "Is a"  
A **schema** defines what the data looks like.&nbsp;"Has a {name} schema"  
A **template** is what it looks like visually. "Rendered with a&nbsp;{name} template"
