# RFC 95: Long term future of applications

## Summary

This RFC describes the direction of travel for the applications that make up GOV.UK.

## Problem

We currently have 58 separate applications running on GOV.UK. The [Platform architecture principles][princ] explain where we're going from an architectural standpoint. This RFC is an attempt to explain the long term vision of each of GOV.UK's apps.

The purpose of doing this is to make clear:

- where to put new functionality
- which applications need particular attention
