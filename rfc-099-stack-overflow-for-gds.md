# Q&A Forum for GDS developers

## Summary

A searchable, long-lived body of developer knowledge would make finding
answers easier.

StackOverflow is a Q&A forum that all developers at GDS are familiar with.
A private instance of StackOverflow would ensure that valuable knowledge
is retained and more easily found.

## Problem

When faced with a problem we're not able to solve, we ask for help from
other developers in person or over Slack.

Both of these methods mean that developer knowledge is quite often lost,
and time is spent finding answers to the same problems. The solutions
remain in Slack, and aren't easily retrievable.

## Proposal

I propose GDS uses [StackOverflow for Teams](https://stackoverflow.com/teams).

As developers, we all know the value of StackOverflow. I've used their Teams
product before and have found it very useful.

StackOverflow allows for org-specific tagging (e.g. `publishing-api`).

Developers can gain karma, and be more easily recognised for helping others.

This should result in more documentation. Questions and answers will be
preserved, and frequently asked questions will be more visible and can
be written up into documentation.

It's possible to export data from StackOverflow for Teams, even after we
stop paying for it, which will help to prevent lock-in.

You can integrate StackOverflow with Slack, and post new questions into channels.

There is a 14 day free trial so we could try out it out.
