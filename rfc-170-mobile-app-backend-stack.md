# Back end stack for GOV.UK App backends

This RFC has been put back into 'draft' state and is being fully revised following direction from senior leadership that within GOV.UK we are building a standalone app platform distinct from DI's.

As a result, the rationale and motivations for what we build and how have shifted significantly, so this will need some further thought.

Stay put for further updates.
