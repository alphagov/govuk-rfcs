# Replacing Static

## Summary

We propose two new gems: `govuk_web_banners` and `govuk_web_static_content` which will replace the [slimmer] gem, the [static] application, and will give us the option if necessary to remove parts of the [govuk_publishing_components] gem that might not belong there. Between them and some devolution of code to existing apps they will handle static’s four main responsibilities: banners, static assets, error pages and layouts, but in a less astonishing way. They will also simplify configuration of the shared header and footer content.

## Problem

The `static`/`slimmer`/`govuk_publishing components` triumviurate is a clever way of doing the jobs that it does, but it sits outside the normal idiom of how rails apps render pages, which makes it hard to understand. We have a public layout component in the `govuk_publishing_components` gem that is used to render pages in a standard way in frontend apps, but instead of accessing it directly (remember all frontend apps include the gem), they have to make a call to `slimmer` to request the variant of that layout they want, at which point `slimmer` inserts middleware that makes a network call to `static` for that layout variant. `Static` then reads that layout from its internal copy of the `govuk_publishing_components gem`, modifies it slightly to include global and emergency banners, then returns that value to the `slimmer` middleware, which slots the rendered page from the app into that returned layout.

Making a remote call through middleware to get a layout which the app already has is not an idiomatic rails way of rendering a page, and it presents a complexity barrier to changes to the frontend apps.

The reason for this complex system is that it gives `static` the ability to centralise static assets and handle adding various banners into apps. Those abilities haven't been trivial to replace. Previous RFCs have touched on: a replacing `static` with a gem ([RFC-84]), adding shared asset folders ([RFC-91]) or the gordian knot solution of merging all affected apps ([RFC-174]). They've also looked at related problems of shared configuration by moving the content that populates header and footer into the content store ([RFC-118]). Although ultimately these RFCs were not implmented, the good news is that they were all pretty good solutions to part of the problem, they just needed some advancements in how our apps were built and deployed (which we now have). We’ve also established that some of the things static does can be done at a slightly slower pace and still be acceptable (for instance, that a 15 minute lag between the emergency banner being deployed and being visible site-wide is acceptable ([RFC-144])).


## Solutions

### The Emergency Banner (move to `govuk_web_banners`)

The current mechanism for deploying the emergency banner is via a shared redis instance. A UI in [whitehall] allows the banner to be set. The details of the banner are written into a redis key, and `static` reads that key every time it responds to a layout request, including the details of the banner in the response if present. There is no local caching of this request in `static`, but `slimmer`’s calls to `static` are cached for 60 seconds, so the redis cluster is being called at most 1 time per minute per application instance (not per application, unless the applications are sharing a cache). This means that there is a theoretical lag of up to a minute between the banner being published and it being displayed, but since the CDN caches all pages for 5 minutes anyway, this lag doesn’t have a big effect on deployment of the banner, and at any rate it’s been established that 15 minutes is acceptable delay between the button being pressed and the banner being available ([RFC-144])

Our proposal is that instead of `static` making this call to redis, all frontend apps be given read access to the same redis cluster (some of them may already have access to it), and they make the call directly through the new `govuk_web_banners` gem. This call can itself be cached for a minute, so in theory the number of calls to the redis cluster would remain the same, but we could then lose all the calls to `static` (which are likely to be a bit heavier-weight than the redis calls)

Longer-term, we could replace the redis call with a similarly-cached call to a [content-store] item for the various banners, which would allow us to make the various banners first-class content items with scheduling support (see also "The Global Banner"). It’s worth noting that we could also replace redis with content-store calls directly in `static`, but either way the change would be done in only one place, so that more desirable solution to handling banner content is neutral regarding whether the display is done in `static` or a gem. To implement banners in `content-store` we could either create a new schema for banners or perhaps implement them as reusable content blocks, if that project becomes realised.

### The Global Banner (move to `govuk_web_banners`)

The current mechanism for the global banner is via code directly in `static`. Adding a banner is a developer task. This allows one slight advantage over the emergency banner, which is that the code can change the banner content at a particular time (eg [removing a voter id banner] when the polls close in an election)

Our proposal is that the global banner ultimately be deployed using the same mechanism as the emergency banner, but with additional information baked into the values put into the redis store. Since redis naturally supports key expiration, the act of removing banners at a certain time would be pretty easy. Banners appearing at a certain time would be more awkward, but not insurmountable. These changes would make it deployable by content specialists as well as developers, and should be able to be implemented with minimal changes to `whitehall`.

In the short-term, just moving the existing global banner code into the gem with the recruitment banners and emergency banner would also simplify ensuring that recruitment and global banners are not shown when an emergency banner is in effect.

Longer-term, maintaining the same mechanism as emergency banners, we could look to make global banners first-class publishing items as well, which would give us standard scheduled publication options.

### Recruitment Banners (move to `govuk_web_banners`)

This isn’t a problem with `static`, but fits the banner theme and provides a neat start to the banner gem. Recruitment banners present a problem in that they often need to be inserted into the body of a page inside the area that `static` normally considers the app’s section (the wrapper). This means they need to be maintained in multiple apps.

Our proposal is that we include the current duplicated recruitment banner config, code, and partial views in the gem. Then we can include the gem in each application and put a single call to it in the relevant app layouts. This means we can keep the configuration in one place, where it’s more easily checked for problems, and a single release of the banner gem will be automatically pulled into each relevant app at the next dependabot merge.

### Static Assets (move to `govuk_web_static_content`)

#### How GOV.UK handles assets

GOV.UK uses the standard rails assets pipeline for creation of assets, in which at asset compile time a fingerprint is generated for each asset based on the asset’s content, and during HTML page rendering the base names of the assets are replaced with the fingerprinted version. This allows clients to implement a pretty simple caching policy - they can always cache a given asset for as long as they like, because the asset’s name will change if the content changes - if the client doesn’t already have that fingerprinted file, they will need to download it.

Asset pre-compilation happens when the container image is built (during the ‘deploy’ GitHub Actions workflow). This process generates the compiled assets and the Sprockets manifest. The manifest is the mechanism for Rails to map the original asset name (`search-button.png`) to the fingerprinted asset name (`search-button-b2ba232ade53223.png`), so the deployed app has a record of everything that was compiled as part of its assets:precompile step.

Upon deployment into the Kubernetes cluster, a job runs which copies anything from `/app/public/assets/<name of app>` into an S3 bucket `s3://govuk-app-assets-<environment>/assets/<name of app>`. [Fastly maps] any call for (e.g.) `https://www.gov.uk/assets/` to that bucket, so a request for `https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/search-button-b2ba232ade53223.png` will be served from that s3 bucket.

![Current asset deploy pathway](rfc-176/current_govuk_asset_pathway.png)

#### What this means for `static`'s assets

Because the upload-assets job in [govuk-helm-charts] includes the app name, there currently isn’t a mechanism for apps to upload assets in a shared context. If we move `static`'s assets into a gem, and two apps both precompile the gem's search-button.png, for instance, the fingerprint will be the same, but the path will be different, so a client that views two pages with the search button (one in [frontend], one in [government-frontend]) will download the same file twice.

However, because all of these apps upload to different folders in the same S3 bucket, it would be relatively to just remove the app name from the path, so that all assets were just compiled into `/app/public/assets` on the deployed images and upload that to a shared folder (indeed, this is the default for rails, so we could actually remove a configuration line from every app). Because the same asset compiled in two different apps ends up with the same name, the second app’s uploaded asset would overwrite the first one with the exact same name and data. S3 writes are transactional, so two apps uploading at the exact same time should not be a problem.

#### Additional benefits

Moving to this simpler compilation method also allows apps to share assets provided by other gems (like the `govuk_publishing_components` gem), improving the end-user experience still further. This same simplification can easily be applied to other apps.

![Proposed asset deploy pathway](rfc-176/proposed_govuk_asset_pathway.png)

### Error Pages (move to `govuk_web_static_content`, pick one app (probably `frontend`) to host tasks)

Currently error pages are rendered by static during a deploy rake task, and uploaded to an S3 bucket.. We propose moving the error page templates into the static content gem, which will allow them to be laid out in one place and in future potentially returned as they might normally be returned by a rails app. For the moment, though, a single app would be picked to render the pages for upload to the S3 bucket - `frontend` seems like the natural host, since [RFC-175] proposes merging a number of the other frontend apps into that.

### Layouts (call directly within apps)
All of the layouts in `static` are banner-aware configuration wrappers around a call to the public layout component included in the `govuk_publishing_components` gem. In practise this means that applications are having to make network calls to ask another application to return them a layout that they already have access to, and could easily configure themselves if necessary.

We propose that we move the layout calls to inside the frontend apps, determine if the additional configuration is something that can be provided in a default load-time step and explicitly overridden by the applications. This should give us more flexibility in terms of personalisation.

### Header and Footer Content (move into `govuk_web_static_content` from `govuk_publishing_components` and `frontend`)
Updating header and footer content is a developer task in `govuk_publishing_components` and in `frontend` - there are no content items that can be edited in the publishing apps. Ideally we’d prefer this not to be the case, but that’s out of the scope of this current document.

We propose for the moment moving the header and footer content into the static content gem, where it can be included directly into the apps (and into the layouts the apps will at that point be handling). This gives us an improved developer experience to today (in that editing the content would be in one place), while allowing us to remove that configuration from `govuk_publishing_components` and in `frontend`.

### Additional Considerations

Adding a couple more gems to every frontend app may mean that frontend development may become more awkward in situations where local versions of multiple gems are needed. These are likely to be few, but we should be prepared to monitor the developer experience in these situations. Hopefully, though, the clear division of purpose between these gems and the components gem should mean that most work can be done with at most one local gem.

If we move components into the gem (for instance, the global banner, which is currently an app component in static), we will try to ensure that the component guide from the gem treats them the same way it does in-app components, and we do not have to replicate the component guide code inside the gem.

## Proposed Roadmap

There are three initial streams, reflecting the fact that the gems could potentially be worked on independently. The work in each stream is arranged so that even if we don’t take the ultimate step, we’ll still be doing useful work. After these streams are complete, a final stream of work can retire `static`. There is also an optional stream to share assets from other gems between the apps, which could be started before or after the otherk work streams.

### Stream 1: Banner Gem
- Create prototype banner gem.
- Moving the recruitment banners into that gem, trial including them in one of the four apps which currently contain recruitment banner code.
- If trial looks promising, move the other three apps to use the gem.
- Move the emergency banner code into the gem, and include the gem in `static`
- Move current global banner code code into the gem, and use that code in `static`
- Convert the global banner code to use the same Redis system that the emergency banner uses.

### Stream 2: Static Content Gem
- Create prototype static content gem
- Trial moving static's error page content into the gem, and allowing a single app (`frontend`) to render/upload them in the same way static does now.
- Trial moving static's assets into the gem, and allowing a host app to compile them into the shared asset bucket.
- Add a second app to the trial, to ensure that the shared assets / error pages can still be served.
- Move header/footer content into the gem,

### Stream 3: Layouts in Apps
- Trial modifying an app ([email-alert-frontend], because it has one of the most complicated current uses of static layouts) to use the layouts directly (this would be partially reliant on Stream 1 for production-readiness, because it would need banner gem support for banners, but the trial can start independently)
- Modify the rest of the apps.

### Optional Stream: Shared assets in other apps
- Trial simplifying how other apps compile their assets so that they put them in the assets root rather than in subfolders.

### Final Stream: Retire static

- Trial moving a single app away from `static` to using the banner and layout gems.
- If trial is successful, move remaining apps to the new system.
- Retire `static`/`slimmer`

## When Would These Gems Be Retired, and when would they change?

It's worth adding a little bit about what the predicted lifespan of these gems would be, so that we have a clear idea of when it would make sense to retire, merge, or add to them.

### The `govuk_web_banner` gem

The banner gem is useful as long as there are multiple front-end apps that need to render the various banners. At the moment this is _all_ frontend apps for the emergency and global banners, and a subset for the recruitment banners. If that subset (or all) of the frontend apps were merged, we should consider whether to move the gem into that combined app. We could also merge this gem into the layout gem, given that most of the frontend apps relying on the banner gem would ultimately be using the layout gem too.

It's also worth noting that the components used by this gem are _only_ used by this gem at the moment. If we think that is likely to be the case forever, we could move them into this gem and out of `govuk_publishing_components`.

### The `govuk_web_static_content` gem

Most of the work of this gem is in supporting assets that need to be available to all pages and configuration of shared menus. If the frontend apps are all merged, this content can become part of that app and the gem can be retired.

If we consider the public layout component unnecessary to maintain in `govuk_publishing_components`, it could be moved into this gem, and then later into the frontend app if there is only one.
