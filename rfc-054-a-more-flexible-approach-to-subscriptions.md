## Problem

Our current system of subscriptions is strictly "taxonomy based", that is, you are only able to subscribe to groupings of content such as [topics](https://www.gov.uk/topic/oil-and-gas/fields-and-wells/email-signup), [organisations](https://www.gov.uk/government/email-signup/new?email_signup%5Bfeed%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Forganisations%2Fcabinet-office.atom), [document types](https://www.gov.uk/government/email-signup/new?email_signup%5Bfeed%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications.atom), [policies](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/access-to-the-countryside/email-signup) etc. and then receive updates when any content is tagged to a grouping or set of groupings you have subscribed to.

There is [mounting evidence](https://docs.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/presentation/d/1XP-ejOSiJJ15FN6jkFWRKUTimdE44T48NXVHeaGky04/edit?usp=sharing) of&nbsp;
